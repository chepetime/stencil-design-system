## Development

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

Make sure you have the LTS version of [Node](https://nodejs.dev/) (18.7) installed in your machine. We recommend to use [nvm (Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

```sh
pnpm install
```
